# GO for TNS/X Binary Interchange

Binary interchange repository for go binaries set up for TNS/X

The purpose of this project is to allow an easy interchange of GO compiler packages and
provide incremental save-points as progress is made on the compiler.

The first set of binary commits will be attempts at initial executables on the TNS/X
platform. These will be tagged appropriately.

Further descriptions will be defined as we get going on the project.
